    "## Getting data from the web\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have enough programming scaffolding in place to start talking about how to access Web APIs. A web API is some collection of data, made available on the web, provided in a format easy for computers to parse. But in order to write programs to access web APIs, I need to talk about a few other things first."

    "### URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "A URL (\"uniform resource locator\") uniquely identifies a document on the web, and provides instructions for how to access it. It's the thing you type into your web browser's address bar. It's what you cut-and-paste when you want to e-mail an article to a friend. Most of what we do on the web---whether we're using a web browser or writing a program that accesses the web---boils down to manipulating URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's important for us to understand the structure of URLs, so we can take them apart and put them back together (both in our heads and programmatically). URLs have a conventional structure that is specified in Internet standards documentation, and many of the web APIs we'll be accessing assume knowledge of this structure. So let's take the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "    http://www.example.com/foo/bar?arg1=baz&arg2=quux\n",
    "    \n",
    "... and break it down into parts, so we have a common vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Part | Name |\n",
    "|------|------|\n",
    "| `http` | scheme |\n",
    "| `www.example.com` | host |\n",
    "| `/foo/bar` | path |\n",
    "| `?arg1=baz&arg2=quux` | query string |\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these parts are required, except for the query string, which is optional. Explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The *scheme* determines what *protocol* will be used to access this resource. For our purposes, this will almost always be `http` (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or `https` (HTTP, but over an encrypted connection).\n",
    "* The *host* specifies which server on the Internet we're going to talk to in order to retrieve the document we want.\n",
    "* The *path* names a resource on the server, often using slashes (`/`) to represent hierarchical relationships between resources. (Sometimes this corresponds to actual files on the server, but just as often it does not.)\n",
    "* The *query string* is a means to tell the server *how* we want the document delivered. (More examples of this soon.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the work you'll do in learning how to use a web API is learning how to construct and manipulate URLs. A quick glance through [the documentation for, e.g., the Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) reveals that the bulk of the documentation is just a big list of URLs, with information on how to adjust those URLs to get the information you want."

    "### HTML, JSON and web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common format for documents on the web is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Web browsers like HTML because they know how to render as human-readable documents---in fact, that's what web browsers are for: turning HTML from the web into visually splendid and exciting multimedia affairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML was specifically designed to be a tool for creating web pages, and it excels at that, but it's not so great for describing structured data. Another popular format---and the format we'll be learning how to work with this week---is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Like HTML, JSON is a format for exchanging structured data between two computer programs. Unlike HTML, JSON is primarily intended to communicate content, rather than layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, whenever a web site exposes a URL for human readers, the document at that URL is in HTML. Whenever a web site exposes a URL for programmatic use, the document at that URL is in JSON. (There are other formats commonly used for computer-readable documents, like XML. But let's keep it simple for now.) As an example, Wordnik has a human-readable version of page for the definition of the word \"hello,\" found at this URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://wordnik.com/words/hello\n",
    "\n",
    "But Wordnik also has a version of this data designed to be easily readable by computers. This is the URL, and it returns a document in JSON format:\n",
    "\n",
    "> http://api.wordnik.com:80/v4/word.json/hello/definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Every web site makes available a number of URLs that return human-readable documents; many web sites (like Twitter) also make available URLs that return documents intended to be read by computer programs. Often---as is the case with Facebook, or with sites like Metafilter that make their content available through RSS feeds---these are just two views into the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a web API as the set of URLs, and rules for manipulating URLs, that a web site makes available and that are also intended to be read by computer programs. (API stands for \"application programming interface\"; a \"web API\" is an interface enables you to program applications that use the web site's data.)"

    "### API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed when you clicked on the \"computer-readable\" link above that you received the following message (or one like it) in your web browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\"message\": \"unauthorized\", \"type\": \"error\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "This message results from the fact that most web APIs (unlike most web pages) require some kind of *authentication*. \"Authentication\" here means some kind of information that associates the request with an individual. In many APIs, this takes the form of a \"token\" or \"key\" (also called a \"client ID\" and/or \"secret\")---most usually an extra parameter that you pass on the end of the URL (or in an HTTP header) that identifies the request as having come from a unique user. Some services (like Facebook) provide a subset of functionality to non-authenticated (\"anonymous\") requests; others require authentication for all requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you get \"keys\" or \"tokens\"? There's usually some kind of sign-up form in or near the developer documentation for the service in question. Sign up for Wordnik [here](http://developer.wordnik.com/), or Foursquare [here](https://developer.foursquare.com/) (click on \"My Apps\" in the header after you've logged in). The form may ask you for a description of your application; it's usually safe to leave this blank, or to put in some placeholder text. Only rarely is this text reviewed by an actual human being; your key is usually issued automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different services have different requirements regarding how to include your keys in your request; you'll have to consult the documentation to know for sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following examples, I'll assume you've acquired an access token for the APIs in question and have assigned them to variables in the programs as appropriate."

    "### Fetching web documents with `requests`\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to make (most) web API requests is a web browser. But it would be tedious to do these requests in a web browser and then copy over the responses into Python for analysis. We may also want to make *many* requests to a web API (for example, to get hundreds of words from Wordnik), which is inconvenient to do \"by hand\" with a web browser. Ideally, there would be some way to make web requests *directly inside a Python program*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does, in fact, have a built-in library ([urllib.request](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html)) just for this purpose! Actually, a number of other programmers have contributed their own libraries for making web requests in Python which improve on the capabilities of the built-in Python library. One of these is [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) which we'll be using below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the `requests` library is to make requests to web servers in order to retrieve web documents. You give it a URL, and it gives back a string that contains the content of the document located at that URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `requests`. Our task here is to fetch the document at the URL given above, for the computer-readable version of Wordnik's definitions for the word \"hello\":"

    "Many web sites and organizations offer web APIs. We're going to go over how one API in particular works, or at least a subset of a particular web API---the [World Air Quality Index API](http://aqicn.org/api/). The idea is that by introducing you to this one API, you'll learn the tools necessary to sign up for, query, and interpret APIs from other providers as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signing up for an API key\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use the Air Quality Index API, you need to sign up for an API key. Do so by going to the API's [token request form](http://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/) and following the instructions. You'll need to provide your e-mail address. (When I signed up, I got my confirmation e-mail and API key very quickly!)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Looking at the documentation\n",

    "The documentation for a web API usually describes what the API can do in terms of the URLs you can access, the patterns that those URLs follow, and the format of the responses.

    "* The `Parameter` table shows what the placeholder values mean. (Don't worry about the `callback` parameter—that's only useful if you're a Javascript programmer.)\n",

Important items in this dictionary are the air quality index itself (`aqi`), the ID of the station (`uid`) and the `station` key, which points to *another* dictionary with the name of the station (`name`) and a `url` field, that can be used with a different API endpoint to get more detail about a particular station. Using just this data, we could write a loop to make a simple report on our findings:"

If you put `params=` into the arguments of the call to `requests.get()`, the library will take the dictionary that you passed and use it to form a query string. It does this so you don't have to figure out how to write the query string yourself.\n",

The ID is a bit less ambiguous, so I'm going to use that in the subsequent examples. (The ID is in the search results as the value for key `uid`. The documentation also states that if you use the ID, you need to precede it with a `@` symbol, which is reflected in the code below.)\n",

Essentially, the line starting with the `with` keyword creates a new file object with the filename `aqi_export.csv` and assigns it to a variable called `filehandle`.\n",

    "In the indented section beneath, we create a special kind of Python value called a \"CSV writer\" (from the csv module), passing it the file object as a parameter. The writer object has one method of importance to us, .writerow(), which takes a list of values. The writer object takes the values passed to .writerow(), formats them by converting them to strings and inserting commas between them, and writes them to the file opened in the initial line of the with clause. The first call to .writerow() writes the header row, which our spreadsheet software will interpret as column names. Inside a `for` loop, we visit each row from the `table` list made in the previous step and write it to the file.\n",
